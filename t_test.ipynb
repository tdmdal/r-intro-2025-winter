        "In this notebook, we learn how to use R to perform a t-test. I assume that you know what a t-test is, and therefore will only focus on the R coding part. Nevertheless, I will briefly review the concept of t-test.\n",
        "\n",
        "T-test is a statistical hypothesis test for evaluating means of one or two populations. There are three kinds of t-tests for mean comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A *one-sample t-test* is used to decide if the population mean is equal to a specific value or not, e.g., whether the mean heart rate of a group of people is equal to 70 or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. A *two-sample t-test* is used to decide if the population means for two different groups are equal or not, e.g., whether the mean heart rates for two groups of people are the same or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. A *paired t-test* is used to decide if the difference between paired measurements for a population is zero or not, e.g., whether mean difference in heart rate for a group of people before and after exercise is zero or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "To perform a t-test, you can follow the below steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Define the hypothesis you are going to test (null hypothesis $H_0$ and alternative hypothesis $H_a$), and specify an acceptable risk of drawing a faulty conclusion, i.e., the type-I error rate (or significance level), $\\alpha$ (e.g., $\\alpha=0.05$).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Calculate a test statistic from your data, and compare it to a theoretical value (critical value) from a t-distribution. Alternatively, you can calculate the p-value corresponding to the test statistics. Depending on the outcome, you either reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "See [here](https://www.jmp.com/en_ca/statistics-knowledge-portal/t-test.html) for a discussion on the three t-tests including an excellent comparison table. Most of my above discussion are drawn from there.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note 1**: t-test is also commonly used in linear regression analysis to test whether a coefficient/slope of a regressor (i.e., a predictor or a explanatory variable) is equal to zero. You will see this when we discuss how to run linear regression using R.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note 2**: People often believe that t-test requires the assumption that the data follows a normal distribution. However, by the central limit theorem, sample mean of moderately large samples (a size above 30) is often well-approximated by a normal distribution, even if the individual data are not normally distributed. In fact, that's often good enough for t-test, so for large samples, the t-test can be applied without the data being strictly from a normal distribution ([Lumley et. al., 2002](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11910059/)). On the other hand, it is still important to ensure that other assumptions of the t-test are met: 1) the sample data are randomly sampled from a population; 2) for two-sample t-test, the variability of the data in each group is similar. (However, if samples are from normal distribution and the sizes of the two groups are the same, t-test is highly robust to the presence of unequal variances ([Markowski & Markowski, 1990](https://doi.org/10.2307/2684360)))."
