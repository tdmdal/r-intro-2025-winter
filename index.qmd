title: "R Intro (Winter 2025 / RSM456)"
---

R is an open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. R is extensible, and has a large collection of high-quality user contributed packages that provides easy tools for common data analysis tasks. This 4-session workshop will introduce you the basics of R programming and data analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What To Prepare

Please install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) before the first session.

If you encounter technical difficulties installing the software, you can instead create a free [RStudio Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) account so you can run R in the cloud via your browser.

An alternative to RStudio Cloud is the UofT JupyterHub/RStudio system. Go to its [home page](https://datatools.utoronto.ca/), choose the *RStudio* option, and click *LOG IN* button. You will need your UTORid to login.
