R is extensible, and has a large collection of high-quality user contributed packages that provides easy tools for common data analysis tasks. This 4-session workshop will introduce you the basics of R programming and data analysis.\n\n\nWhat To Prepare\nPlease install R and RStudio Desktop before the first session.\nIf you encounter technical difficulties installing the software, you can instead create a free RStudio Cloud account so you can run R in the cloud via your browser.\nAn alternative to RStudio Cloud is the UofT JupyterHub/RStudio system. Go to its home page, choose the RStudio option, and click LOG IN button. You will need your UTORid to login.\n\n\n\nSession 1 Basics\n\nSlides\n\nNavigate RStudio\nInstall and load R packages\nLoad/import a tabular dataset into a dataframer/tibble\nR basic syntax (data and programming structures)\n\nData\n\nHousing price (hprice.csv)\nCountry risk (country_risk.xlsx)\n\nCode\n\nGet started (We will code this one together)\nR basic data structures (R Notebook )\nR basic programming structures (R Notebook )\n\nReading list\n\nHands-on Programming with R (Chapter 1 to 3; Chapter 4 to 7, 9 and 11; Appendix A, B and D)\n\n\n\n\nSession 2 Descriptive Statistics, T-test, and Linear Regression\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\nSession 3 K-means Clustering, and Principal Components Analysis\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\nSession 4 Logistic Regression\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nFrom Zero to Hero\n\nStep 1: Hands-on Programming with R (beginner level; learn R programming basics.)\nStep 2: R for Data Science (intermediate level; learn to manipulate, analyze and visualize data using R’s Tidyverse packages.)\nStep 3: Advanced R (advanced level; learn to master R.)\n\nOther Resources\n\nA Short R Tutorial by Germán Rodríguez\nR for Reproducible Scientific Analysis (from software carpentry)\nProgramming with R (from software carpentry)\nR Graphics Cookbook\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\nThe R Graph Gallery (R graph samples with code)\nR Cheat Sheets (cheat sheets for many popular R packages)\nDoSStoolkit (self-paced interactive modules to help you learn and use R from Uoft Dept. of Statistical Science)\n\n\n\nBack to TDMDAL Computing Page"
